# Analysis of Student Performance

### Note: This project is not complete and is in progress.
## Project Overview
In this analysis, we delve into the factors that influence the academic scores of students, examining elements like gender, ethnicity, parental education, lunch types, and the impact of test preparation courses. Through data-driven insights and machine learning models, we aim to predict the outcomes of student performances.

## Data Overview
The analysis is based on a Kaggle dataset containing details of 1000 students across 8 different attributes, focusing on both their demographic background and educational scores.

## Analytical Models
Throughout this project, we will evaluate various machine learning models to forecast student test scores, including:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Neighbors Regressor
- Support Vector Machine
- AdaBoost
- XGBoost
- CatBoost

## Technical Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
